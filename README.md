<h2> Driver </h2>
To correct work you need to download driver for your browser. For Chrome it is <a href="https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads" target="_blank">Chrome Driver</a>. Pay attention: it is important to <b>check version of browser</b>! After downloading driver you need to locate directory with file to root directory called "drivers/driver-name_os-name/driver-name.exe"
